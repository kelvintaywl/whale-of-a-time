This repository explores all the typical Docker-related operations within CI builds.

In these samples, we will be using CircleCI for our CI builds.

Please see the various workflows declared in `.circleci/config.yml` for examples.


## Notes

Some of these examples can really be simplified by using many of the orbs offered by CircleCI!
In particular, we could simplify our lives with the powerful [Docker orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/docker).

However, in these examples, I would like to keep it as 'low-tech' as possible.


## Example workflows

### `build_test_publish`

This workflow builds a custom Nginx image, tests that our image can be spin up before publishing to a image repository (Docker Hub in this case).

**Bonus**: We also take a screenshot of the custom Nginx server's web page [here](https://24-416657252-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/screenshot.png)

The published image is hosted in Docker Hub.

[![dockeri.co](https://dockeri.co/image/kelvintaywl/fancy-nginx)](https://hub.docker.com/r/kelvintaywl/fancy-nginx)

Features:
 - `docker image build`
 - `docker container run`
 - [dockerize](https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize) tool
 - `docker image push`
 - `docker cp`

### `compose_tests`

This workflow spins up 2 containers of a fictional service (1 DB, 1 web app) via Docker-Compose, and runs integration tests ([Newman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman)) against the web app.

Features:
 - `docker-compose -p ${prefix} up`
 - `nc` command as _an alternative_ to check if server is up
 - [Postman collections](https://www.postman.com/collection/)
 - [Newman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/)
